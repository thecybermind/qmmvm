CHANGE LOG
Version: 0.4.0b (8/29/04)
	- Added JK2 support
	- Added qmmvm_stacksize cvar to allow custom stack sizes
	- Added 'savemem' parameter to VM_Restart() to specify whether or not to reload into same memory space
	- Added QMMVM_VERSION_DWORD macro and support for including version.h in qmmvm.rc
	- Optimized big-endian machine support for VMs (but there's only x86 servers? oh well)
	- Optimized VM loading (slightly)
	- Changed OP_UNDEF, OP_NOP, OP_BREAK, and default opcodes to error in console output only (no shutdown)
	- Removed g_vmerror flag variable, now checks g_VM.memory value

Version: 0.3.0b (7/28/04)
	- Added qmmvm_debug 2 setting for op code debugging
	- Added additional VM info to startup and qmmvm_status output
	- Added support for calling real function pointers (for hooking gentity_t function pointer members)
	- Added support for special GAME message value -1 for plugins to use to set VM function for hook chain
	- Added support for dereferencing real pointers (for malloc(), realloc(), free())
	- Heavily commented VM code
	- Changed handling of OP_BREAK to use G_ERROR syscall (rather than trying to dereference NULL)
	- Changed location of debug log, qmmvmlog.txt is now in the mod directory
	- Removed vmptr() macro for VM_SysCalls (since real pointers are handled properly)
